# coreHudSwitch
Recreation of CoreGui in newer versions, backported to 2012 ROBLOX! For use in Novetus by Bitl.

# How to Use.
1. Download "ToolTipper.lua" from the releases.
2. Rename ToolTipper.lua in novetus\data\clients\(client)\scripts\core\ to "ToolTipper.lua.bak"
3. Paste the downloaded ToolTipper.lua into the novetus\data\clients\(client)\scripts\core\ folder.

# Limitations
This doesn't work on any versions pre-2011.
Versions before 2011 don't use Lua CoreGui, and so, don't have any core scripts.
